         <p>Quincy Larson is a teacher who learned to code, started working as a developer, and wanted to help more people do the same. So he created the freeCodeCamp.org open source project.</p>

         <p>Today freeCodeCamp.org is helping millions of people around the world learn to code for free. Already, tens of thousands of alumni have gotten their first jobs as software developers.</p>

         <p>freeCodeCamp has a free 1,800 hour full stack development curriculum where you build projects and earn developer certifications. They also run the fastest-growing programming channel on YouTube and the largest publication on Medium.com.</p>

         <p>Their nonprofit has crossed the 1 billion minute threshold for total usage. This means people have spent about 2,000 years learning to code on freeCodeCamp.</p>
